## CRT TV 3D model

["Magnavox 19" CRT TV - RR1938 W122"](https://skfb.ly/o6xw8) by

Used as the player's TV set, embedded as glTF for web rendering.

## Video content

**The Internet Archive** — https://archive.org

Every episode of *It's Your Move* this player streams comes from
[a single archive.org item](https://archive.org/details/Its_Your_Move_1984)
that bundles the complete series as individual files. 18 episodes (NBC,
1984-85) — the short-lived Jason Bateman sitcom. Deep gratitude to whoever
assembled and uploaded the whole run in one place. Support the Archive:

*It's Your Move* is the property of its respective rights holders; this
project streams a publicly hosted recording and hosts no video content
itself.

## Episode titles

The source files have no per-episode titles baked into their filenames —
just season/episode numbers — so the guide lists each entry as "S01E01"
etc. without a title.

## Format note

Unlike VaultVision's other players (SNICK, TGIF, Fox Kids, etc.), this isn't
a multi-hour broadcast block — every entry is one full, self-contained
episode. So a quick REW/FF tap pages to the previous/next episode instead
of seeking within one (wrapping from the last episode back to the first and
vice versa) — same destination as picking it from GUIDE. Press-and-hold
still scrubs through the current episode, unchanged.

## Captions

No captions yet for this player — `captions.js` is an empty placeholder.

## Everything else

- **[three.js](https://threejs.org)** (MIT) — 3D rendering, including
  GLTFLoader, OrbitControls, and CSS3DRenderer.
- **VCR OSD Mono** typeface by Riciery Leal — the on-screen display font,
  served via [CDNFonts](https://www.cdnfonts.com/vcr-osd-mono.font).
- Player engine (the 3D TV, OSD, controls) adapted from the SNICK-lite
  project in this same workspace — same code, different lineup.
